### Introduction
- Generation AI Model also referred as GAN - General Adversarial Networks
- GAN works on a concept of Generator and Discriminator (It evaluates the data created by the generator and give feedback on how to improve the next iteration)
- The two parts work together in a compeition, it helps to create a realistic data.
- Input and Output data is similar, example in fraud management, GANTS model can be made to use synthetic versions of fraudulent transactions, which can be used to train a fraud detection model.
- It provides versatility , can have multiple use cases.

### Variation Autoencoders - VAE
- Variation autoencoders use anomaly detection by training the model on a normal dataset.
-
### Real world example 
- Uber uses VAE to catch fraud in financial transaction
- Google also uses VAE to detect network intrutions using anomaly detection.
- Anamoloy detection in industrial quality control
- Childern's National hospital - uses genAI based on demographic, age to predict disease risk.
